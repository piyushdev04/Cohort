* What is an HTTP Server?
    HTTP: Hyper text transfer Protocol

    1. A protocol that is defined for machines to communicate.
    2. Specifically for websites, it is the most common way for your website's frontend to talk to its backend.


* HTTP Protocol

    In the end, its the client throwing some information at a server
    Server doing somethings with that information
    Server responsing back with the final result

    1. Think of them as functions, where Arguments are something the client sends
    2. Rather than calling a function using its name, the client uses a URL
    3. Rather than the function body, the server does something with the request
    4. Rather than the function returing a value, the server responds with some data

    ** THINGS CLIENT NEEDS TO WORRY ABOUT
        - Protocol(HTTP/HTTPS)
        - Address (URL/IP/PORT)
        - Route
        - Headers Body Query Params
        - Method
    
    ** THINGS SERVER NEEDS TO WORRY ABOUT
        - Response Headers
        - Response Body
        - Status Codes

    ** Things that happen in your browser after you fire this request
       (we will get to how to fire request to a backend server later)

       1. Browser parses the URL
       2. Does a DNS Lookup (converts google.com to an IP)
       3. Establishes a connection to the IP (does handshakeâ€¦)

    ** What is DNS resolution
        URLs are just like contacts in your phone
        In the end, they map to an IP
        If you ever buy a URL of your own, you will need to point it to the IP of your server

    ** Things that happen on your server after the request is received
        1. You get the inputs (route, body, headers)
        2. You do some logic on the input, calculate the output
        3. You return the output body, headers and status code

    ** What are the common methods you can send to your BE server? 
        1. GET
        2. POST
        3. PUT
        4. DELETE

    ** What are the common status codes the backend responds with?
        200 - Everything is ok
        404 - Page/route not found
        403 - Authentication issues
        500 - Internal server error
